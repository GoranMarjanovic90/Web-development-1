    <h1>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?</h1>

    <p><em>William Shakespeare</em></p>

    <p>
        Thou art more <em>lovely</em> and more <strong>temperate</strong>:<br>
        Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
        And summer’s lease hath all too short a <sup>date</sup>;<br>
        Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br>
        And often is his gold complexion <sub>dimm’d</sub>;
    </p>

    <p>
        And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>
        By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm’d;<br>
        But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br>
        Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;<br>
        Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,
    </p>

    <p>
        When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:<br>
        So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,<br>
        So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
    </p>
